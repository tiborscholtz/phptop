## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing PHPTop, make sure you have the following installed:

- **PHP** (7.3 or higher)
- **Apache/Nginx** or any other PHP-compatible web server (optional for local testing)
- **Unix-based OS** (Linux, macOS) or WSL (for Windows)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tiborscholtz/phptop
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd phptop
    ```

3. Configure your web server to point to the PHPTop directory (if you're using Apache or Nginx).

4. Make sure `top` command is available on your system (most Unix-based systems have it pre-installed).

5. Open `index.php` in your browser:

    ```
    http://localhost/phptop
    ```

That's it! PHPTop should now be running on your web server.

## Usage

Once PHPTop is installed, simply navigate to the directory containing the `index.php` file in your browser to start monitoring your systemâ€™s performance. The application will automatically fetch the output of the `top` command and display it in a user-friendly interface.
